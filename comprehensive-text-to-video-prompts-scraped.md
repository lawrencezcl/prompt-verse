## üéØ Core Prompting Principles from Industry Leaders

### 1. **Specificity and Detail**
Based on PixVerse AI documentation:
- ‚úÖ **Good**: "Golden hour sunrise over mountain peaks, mist rising from valleys, eagles soaring in thermals, 4K cinematic"
- ‚ùå **Poor**: "Sunrise video"

### 2. **Technical Parameter Optimization**
From Leonardo.ai best practices:
- **Resolution Selection**: 480p (200 credits), 720p (300 credits), 1080p (premium)
- **Frame Interpolation**: Set to `true` for smooth video equivalent to "Smooth Video" setting
- **Prompt Enhancement**: Enable `promptEnhance` for AI-optimized descriptions

### 3. **Negative Prompt Engineering**
From Pollo AI documentation:
- **Common negative prompts**: `"blurry, low quality, shaky, text, watermark"`
- **Style-specific negatives**: `"cartoon, anime"` (for realistic videos), `"realistic, photo"` (for stylized videos)

### 4. **Aspect Ratio Best Practices**
Industry standards from all platforms:
- **16:9**: Standard landscape (YouTube, cinematic)
- **9:16**: Vertical format (TikTok, Instagram Reels, Shorts)
- **1:1**: Square format (Instagram posts)
- **4:3**: Traditional TV format
- **3:4**: Portrait orientation

## üîß Advanced Prompt Engineering

### Multi-Element Composition
From Leonardo.ai Elements feature:
```json
{
  "prompt": "A futuristic cityscape with flying vehicles",
  "elements": [
    {
      "akUUID": "futuristic-building-element",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "akUUID": "flying-vehicle-element",
      "weight": 0.8
    }
  ]
}
```

### Sequential Video Generation
From SuperDuperAI batch processing:
```typescript
const generateVideoSeries = async (prompts: string[], model = 'comfyui/ltx') => {
  const results = [];

  for (const prompt of prompts) {
    try {
      const videoId = await generateVideo(prompt, model);
      const videoUrl = await waitForVideo(videoId);
      results.push({ prompt, url: videoUrl, success: true });
    } catch (error: any) {
      results.push({ prompt, error: error.message, success: false });
    }

    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000)); // Rate limiting
  }

  return results;
};
```

### Style Transfer Prompts
From platform documentation:
1. **Base Prompt**: "Modern city skyline"
2. **Style Transfer**: "Reinterpret this cityscape with cyberpunk style"
3. **Result**: "Cyberpunk city skyline with neon lights, holographic advertisements, flying vehicles"

## üéØ Best Practices and Optimization

### **Prompt Optimization Strategies**

#### 1. **Detail Level Optimization**
- **Beginner**: Start with simple, clear descriptions
- **Intermediate**: Add camera angles and lighting
- **Advanced**: Include emotional context and narrative elements
- **Professional**: Add technical specifications and artistic direction

#### 2. **Resolution vs. Quality Trade-offs**
- **360p (Turbo)**: Fast generation, lower credits, good for testing
- **540p (Standard)**: Balanced quality and speed
- **720p (Premium)**: High quality, more credits, professional use
- **1080p (Ultra)**: Maximum quality, highest cost, cinematic production

#### 3. **Cost Optimization**
```javascript
// Example: Cost-effective batch processing
const optimizeBatch = (prompts) => {
  return prompts.map(prompt => ({
    prompt,
    resolution: shouldUseHighQuality(prompt) ? "720p" : "540p",
    duration: 5, // Standard duration for cost efficiency
    model: "v4.5" // Latest stable model
  }));
};
```

### **Performance Optimization**

#### 1. **Caching Strategy**
```javascript
const promptCache = new Map();

const getCachedVideo = async (prompt) => {
  if (promptCache.has(prompt)) {
    return promptCache.get(prompt);
  }

  const video = await generateVideo(prompt);
  promptCache.set(prompt, video);
  return video;
};
```

#### 2. **Rate Limiting**
```javascript
const rateLimitedGeneration = async (prompt, delay = 2000) => {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
  return await generateVideo(prompt);
};
```

#### 3. **Error Handling**
```javascript
const robustVideoGeneration = async (prompt, retries = 3) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
    try {
      return await generateVideo(prompt);
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === retries - 1) throw error;
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000 * (i + 1)));
    }
  }
};
```

### **Quality Assurance**

#### 1. **Prompt Validation**
```javascript
const validatePrompt = (prompt) => {
  const requirements = {
    minLength: 10,
    maxLength: 2048,
    forbiddenWords: ['text', 'watermark', 'blurry'],
    requiredElements: ['subject', 'action']
  };

  // Validation logic
  return prompt.length >= requirements.minLength &&
         prompt.length <= requirements.maxLength &&
         !requirements.forbiddenWords.some(word => prompt.toLowerCase().includes(word));
};
```

#### 2. **Quality Metrics**
```javascript
const assessVideoQuality = (videoUrl) => {
  // Implement quality assessment based on:
  // - Resolution check
  // - Motion smoothness
  // - Visual clarity
  // - Prompt adherence
  return qualityScore;
};
```
